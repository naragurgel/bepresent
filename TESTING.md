## Lighthouse 

I Used Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools to test each of the pages for:

- Performance - How the page performs whilst loading.
- Accessibility - How accessible is the site for all users and how can it be improved.
- Best Practices - How does the site conform to industry best practices.
- SEO - Search engine optimisation. Is the site optimised for search engine result rankings.

- As an example, the results for the Be present website for desktop.

## Browser Compatibility

The site was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Mozilla Firefox, with no visible issues for the user. Appearance, functionality and responsiveness were consistent throughout for a range of device sizes and browsers.


## Bugs
### Unresolved
There is a small gap between the logo image and the relax-image for mobile screen that I couldn't adjust.
